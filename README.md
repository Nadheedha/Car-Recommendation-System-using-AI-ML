# Recommendation-System
Abstract: 
An AI survey platform for vehicle manufacturers that integrates with IoT sensors on vehicles. The platform could gather a wealth of data on various aspects of vehicle performance, such as engine speed, fuel consumption, tire pressure, and more. This data could then be analyzed using AI algorithms to identify patterns and trends, and to provide valuable insights into how manufacturers can improve their product performance.Overall,It would be a powerful tool for improving vehicle performance to give out the best product for the customers. 

Conceptual Framework: 
The conceptual framework of this AI survey would include several components, including the 
● NLP algorithms 
● the IoT sensors on vehicles, 
● the data collection and analysis system, 
● the user interface used to display the results.
